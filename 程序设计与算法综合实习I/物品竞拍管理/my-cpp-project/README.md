# My C++ Project

This is a C++ project that implements several classes related to users and items. It provides functionality for managing users and items in a queue and a list.

## Project Structure

The project has the following file structure:

```
my-cpp-project
├── src
│   ├── user.cpp
│   ├── userQueue.cpp
│   ├── item.cpp
│   └── itemList.cpp
├── include
│   ├── user.h
│   ├── userQueue.h
│   ├── item.h
│   └── itemList.h
├── Makefile
└── README.md
```

The `src` directory contains the implementation files for the classes:

- `user.cpp`: Implementation of the `User` class.
- `userQueue.cpp`: Implementation of the `UserQueue` class.
- `item.cpp`: Implementation of the `Item` class.
- `itemList.cpp`: Implementation of the `ItemList` class.

The `include` directory contains the header files for the classes:

- `user.h`: Declaration of the `User` class.
- `userQueue.h`: Declaration of the `UserQueue` class.
- `item.h`: Declaration of the `Item` class.
- `itemList.h`: Declaration of the `ItemList` class.

The `Makefile` is used for building the project. It contains the necessary rules and commands for compiling the source files and generating the executable.

## Building the Project

To build the project, navigate to the root directory and run the following command:

```
make
```

This will compile the source files and generate the executable.

## Running the Project

After building the project, you can run the executable by executing the following command:

```
./my-cpp-project
```

## Documentation

For more information about the classes and their usage, please refer to the header and implementation files in the `src` and `include` directories.
